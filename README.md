### Gource Visualization for your entire Organization

Gource is a great tool to visualize the history of individual repositories.
This tool will help you to visualize an *entire organization's* activities through multiple repositories combined into a single history. You can configure which repositories should be included, which users should be included, and which users (such as bots) should be excluded in a configuration file. This utility will create a combined history of the given repositories and users; then this combined history can be used with Gource to generate an animation of the team's combined history.

### Prerequisites:
```bash
brew install gource ffmpeg
```

## Steps:

1. Install `gource` and `ffmpeg`
2. update `tg.conf` accordly
3. run `php tg.php`
4. run `run-after.sh` without parameters or put with group to render, ex: `run-after.sh DevOps`
5. View the files.

## How to install:
```
composer require ktamas77/team-gource
```

### Configuration example

You need to rename the given `tg.conf.example` file into `tg.conf`, then edit the file.

```yaml

    collection: # List of collections
      - frontend-repos # id of the collection of the repos to scan
    members: # list of the members who are part of your team - only these users will be part of the animation
        - name: Tamas # name of the user as it will be see in the rendered animation
          aliases: [ktamas77, Tamas Kalman, ktamas77@gmail.com] # aliases of the user (it will be combined into one)
        - name: John # another user
          aliases: [john123, John Doe, john@mail.com] # user aliases
    excluded: [automated-script, garbage-collector] # excluded these users; put here the bots, if you have any
